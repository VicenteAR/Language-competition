# language-competition
Language competition study using the mean-field approximation of the Abrams-Strogatz model. This study is performed on a regular lattice, with social interactions between nearest neighbors. 

Contrary to the scenario where the two languages had the same prestige, this model illustrates the situation where one of the languages is more prestigious than the other. As we will see, this will lead to the disappearance of the less renowned language, even if the number of speakers was higher at the starting point.

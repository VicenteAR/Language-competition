# language-competition
Language competition study using the mean-filed approximation of the Abrams-Strogatz model. The study is performed on a regular lattice, with social interactions between nearest neighbours.

The model is started considering a scenario where the two languages have the same prestige s=0.5 and the same number of speakers. The two languages are uniformly distributed.

After the iterative process, one can see the formation of large clusters or islands where individuals speak a specific language.
